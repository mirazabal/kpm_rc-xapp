# xApp with KPM v2.03 and RC v1.03 developed to test with OpenAirInterface

This xApp was developed from the Hello world xApp in Golang, and so it maintains it's original README.md text.
Note that this xApp does not fix OSC RIC bugs, and so, it sometimes may malfunction. Due to the problems that we faced
integrating OSC nearRT-RIC release H with OpenAirInterface RAN, we highly recommend using FlexRIC's nearRT-RIC instead.


# O-RAN-SC Hello World Xapp in Golang

This repository contains open-source code for a prototype golang xAPP for near real-time
RAN Intelligent Controller which makes use of golang Xapp Framework.

This xAPP aims to provide basic implementation of :

1. A1 interfaces interactions

2. Read-write operations into a persistent storage. 

3. xAPP Configuration management

4. RMR Health Check

5. xAPP SDL Check

6. Raising alarms

7. Generating metrics

8. E2 Interface intereactions


## Introduction

This document provides guidelines on how to install and configure the HW Golang xAPP in various environments/operating modes.
The audience of this document is assumed to have good knowledge in RIC Platform.


## Preface
This xAPP can be run directly as a Linux binary, as a docker image, or in a pod in a Kubernetes environment.  The first
two can be used for dev testing. The last option is how an xAPP is deployed in the RAN Intelligent Controller environment.
This covers all three methods. 

1. Docker 

2. Linux Binary

3. Kubernetes 



## Software Installation and Deployment

### Onboarding of hw-go using dms_cli tool

`dms_cli` offers rich set of command line utility to onboard `hw-go` xapp
to `chartmuseme`.

First checkout the [hw-go](https://gerrit.o-ran-sc.org/r/admin/repos/ric-app/hw-go) repository from gerrit.

```
git clone "https://gerrit.o-ran-sc.org/r/ric-app/hw-go"
```

`hw-go` has following folder structure
```
├── Dockerfile
├── INFO.yaml
├── LICENSES.txt
├── README.md
├── config
│   ├── config-file.json           // descriptor for hw-go
│   ├── schema.json                // schema for controls section of descriptor
│   └── uta_rtg.rt                 // local route file
├── docs
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
└── hwApp.go

```

For onboarding `hw-go` make sure that `dms_cli` and helm3 is installed. One can follow [documentation](https://docs.o-ran-sc.org/projects/o-ran-sc-it-dep/en/latest/installation-guides.html#ric-applications) to
configure `dms_cli`.

Once `dms_cli` is availabe we can proceed to onboarding proceure.

configure the `export CHART_REPO_URL` to point `chartmuseme`.
```
$export CHART_REPO_URL=http://<service-ricplt-xapp-onboarder-http.ricplt>:8080
``` 

check if `dms_cli` working fine.
```
$ dms_cli health
True
```

Now move to `config` folder to initiate onboarding.

```
$ cd config
$ dms_cli onboard --config_file_path=config-file.json --shcema_file_path=schema.json
httpGet:
  path: '{{ index .Values "readinessProbe" "httpGet" "path" | toJson }}'
  port: '{{ index .Values "readinessProbe" "httpGet" "port" | toJson }}'
initialDelaySeconds: '{{ index .Values "readinessProbe" "initialDelaySeconds" | toJson }}'
periodSeconds: '{{ index .Values "readinessProbe" "periodSeconds" | toJson }}'

httpGet:
  path: '{{ index .Values "livenessProbe" "httpGet" "path" | toJson }}'
  port: '{{ index .Values "livenessProbe" "httpGet" "port" | toJson }}'
initialDelaySeconds: '{{ index .Values "livenessProbe" "initialDelaySeconds" | toJson }}'
periodSeconds: '{{ index .Values "livenessProbe" "periodSeconds" | toJson }}'

{
    "status": "Created"
}
```

Check if `hw-go` is onborded

```
$ curl --location --request GET "http://<appmgr>:32080/onboard/api/v1/charts"  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'

{
    "hw-go": [
        {
            "name": "hw-go",
            "version": "1.0.0",
            "description": "Standard xApp Helm Chart",
            "apiVersion": "v1",
            "appVersion": "1.0",
            "urls": [
                "charts/hw-go-1.0.0.tgz"
            ],
            "created": "2021-06-24T18:57:41.98056196Z",
            "digest": "14a484d9a394ed34eab66e5241ec33e73be8fa70a2107579d19d037f2adf57a0"
        }
    ]
}

```

If we would wish to download the charts then we can perform following curl operation :

```
curl --location --request GET "http://<appmgr>:32080/onboard/api/v1/charts/xapp/hw-go/ver/1.0.0"  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --output hw-go.tgz
```

Now the onboarding is done.

### Deployment of hw-go 

Once charts are available we can deploy the the `hw-go` using following curl command :

```
$ curl --location --request POST "http://<appmgr>:32080/appmgr/ric/v1/xapps"  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'  --data-raw '{"xappName": "hw-go", "helmVersion": "1.0.0"}'
{"instances":null,"name":"hw-go","status":"deployed","version":"1.0"}
```

Deployment will be done in `ricxapp` ns :

```
# kubectl get po -n ricxapp
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
ricxapp-hw-go-55ff7549df-kpj6k   1/1     Running   0          2m

# kubectl get svc -n ricxapp
NAME                         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
aux-entry                    ClusterIP   IP1             <none>        80/TCP,443/TCP      73d
service-ricxapp-hw-go-http   ClusterIP   IP2             <none>        8080/TCP            103m
service-ricxapp-hw-go-rmr    ClusterIP   IP3             <none>        4560/TCP,4561/TCP   103m

```

Now we can query to appmgr to get list of all the deployed xapps :

```
# curl http://service-ricplt-appmgr-http.ricplt:8080/ric/v1/xapps | jq .
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   347  100   347    0     0    578      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--   579
[
  {
    "instances": [
      {
        "ip": "service-ricxapp-hw-go-rmr.ricxapp",
        "name": "hw-go-55ff7549df-kpj6k",
        "policies": [
          1
        ],
        "port": 4560,
        "rxMessages": [
          "RIC_SUB_RESP",
          "A1_POLICY_REQ",
          "RIC_HEALTH_CHECK_REQ"
        ],
        "status": "running",
        "txMessages": [
          "RIC_SUB_REQ",
          "A1_POLICY_RESP",
          "A1_POLICY_QUERY",
          "RIC_HEALTH_CHECK_RESP"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "name": "hw-go",
    "status": "deployed",
    "version": "1.0"
  }
]

```
